# minepicker

A desktop Flutter application to remotely manage Minecraft instances via HTTP.

This is the frontend of a program I developed starting early 2022 during my Sophomore year of high school and continued developing throughout my Junior year up until early 2023.

There is a backend portion of this program that actually manages the instances on it's filesystem and starts them via an HTTP server constructed using the little [shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf) ecosystem of Dart packages.
